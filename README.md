# 💬 LoanBot: Loan-Based Q&A Chatbot using RAG and Groq

This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that answers questions based on a loan application dataset. It uses semantic search with FAISS and Groq’s LLaMA 3 model to provide natural-language responses to user queries about loan data.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Question-answering based on loan dataset
- 🧠 FAISS-powered vector similarity search
- 🤖 Groq's LLaMA 3 for natural language generation
- 📊 CSV-based knowledge base (loan data)
- 💬 Streamlit interface for easy user interaction

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset (`Training Dataset.csv`) includes attributes like:

- Gender, Marital Status, Dependents
- Education, Employment, Income, Loan Amount
- Loan Term, Credit History, Property Area
- Loan Approval Status

This dataset allows the chatbot to answer queries like:
- What factors affect loan approval?
- What is the average income of applicants?
- Do married applicants get loans more easily?

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Ingestion**: `ingest.py` loads the CSV file and breaks it into textual chunks.
2. **Embedding**: Each chunk is embedded using a SentenceTransformer model.
3. **Indexing**: Embeddings are indexed using FAISS for semantic similarity search.
4. **Retrieval**: Top-k chunks are retrieved based on the user's query.
5. **Generation**: The context + question are sent to Groq's LLaMA3 model to generate a response.

## 🛠️ Installation


1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/loanbot.git
   cd loanbot
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**

   - **On Windows:**
     ```bash
     env\Scripts\activate
     ```
4. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. **Set up your .env file**
   Create a .env file in the root with the following:
   ```bash
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_actual_groq_api_key_here
   ```


   ## 💻 Running the App

1. **Ingest the dataset (run this once to create the FAISS index)**

    ```bash
    python ingest.py
    ```
2. **Start the chatbot using Streamlit**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

   ## 💡 Example Questions

Here are some sample questions you can ask the chatbot based on the loan dataset:

- What is the average loan amount for male applicants?
- How many applicants are self-employed?
- Does education level affect loan approval?
- What property area has the highest loan approval rate?
- How many applicants have a credit history?
- What is the average income of applicants with approved loans?
- Do married applicants get loans more easily?
- How does the number of dependents impact loan approval?
- What is the loan approval rate for graduates?
- Are loans more likely to be approved in urban areas?
